# PathMotion
Simulate path motion using accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data

## Introduction
PathMotion is a Python-based tool that processes motion data from accelerometers and gyroscopes to simulate and visualize movement paths. This project is useful for applications like motion tracking, navigation systems, and activity recognition.

## Features
- Parses motion sensor data to reconstruct movement paths.
- Uses accelerometer and gyroscope readings for precise motion simulation.
- Provides a visual representation of motion.
- Supports customizable input data.
